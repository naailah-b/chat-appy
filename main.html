                Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be
                broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave
                knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the
                highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a
                loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do
                to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are
                much worse. They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your
                eyes. Actually, it's quite good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run
                away. Yeah! And stay out. Wanted. Fairytale creatures. Right, this one is full. Take it away. Give me that. Your fine
                days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch. Next. -Come on. Sit down there! And be quiet! This cage is so small.
                You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please, give me another chance. Oh, shut up! Next.
                What do we got? This little wooden puppet. I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy. Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take
                it away. No! Please, don't let them do it! Next. What do you got? Well, I've got a talking donkey! Right. Well that's
                good for ten schillings, if you can prove it. Oh, go ahead fella. Well? He's just a li..., just a little nervous. He's
                really quite a chatterbox. You boneheaded donkey! That's it. I have heard enough. Guards! No, no, he talks, he does! I
                can talk. I love to talk. I've talked to... Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear! Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He
                can fly! He can talk! -That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey! You might have seen house fly, maybe even a
                superfly. But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly! Seize him! Get him! This way! Hurry! You there. Ogre. -I. By the
                order of lord Farquaad. I am authorized to place you both under arrest. And transport you to designated resettlement
                facility. Oh really? You and what army? Can I say something to you? Listen, you were really, really something, back
                there. Incredible. Are you talking to... ...me? Yes, I was talking to you. Can I just tell you that you were really
                great back there with those guards. They thought that was all over there. And then you showed up and BAM. There was
                tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that. Oh, that's great.
                Really. Man, it's good to be free. Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? But I... I don't
                have any friends. And I'm not going out there by myself. Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea... I'll stick with you. You and me in green
                fighting machine. Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us. Oh, a, that was really scary. Maybe you don't
                mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some
                tic-tac or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man you've ??? my note! Just like the time... ...and then I ate some
                rotten berries. Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day. Why are you following me? I'll tell you why.
                'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me. My problems have all gone. There's no one to derive me. But you
                got to have free ... -Stop singing! Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends. Wow! Only a true friend would be
                that truly honest. Listen! Little donkey. Take a look at me! What am I? A... ...really tall? No! I'm an Ogre. You know,
                grab your torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that bother you? Nope. Really? -Really really. Oh? Man, I like you. What's your
                name? A..., Shrek. Shrek?! But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek? You've got that kind of: "I don't care what
                nobody thinks of me" thing. I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right. Uh, look at that. Who would wanna live
                in a place like that? That would be my home. Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful. You know you're quite a decorator. It's
                amazing what you did with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess, you don't
                entertain much, do you? I like my privacy. You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common. Like I hate it
                when you got somebody in your face. You try to give them a hint and they won't leave. And then there's that big occurred
                silence, you know? Can I stay with you? -What? Can I stay with you, please. Of course! -Really? No. -Please! I don't
                want to go back there. You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak. Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have
                to stick together! You got to let me stay! Please! Please! OK, OK. -But one night only. -Huh, thank you! A, what are you
                do... No! This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the
